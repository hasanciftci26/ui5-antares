## [1.120.1006] - 2024-06-14

### Added

- It is now possible to disable auto close after the submit is done in EntryCreateCL and EntryUpdateCL classes. To close and destroy the dialog manually, the **closeAndDestroyEntryDialog()** method can be utilized.

### Fixed

- The issue with label generation from the metadata for custom controls in the SMART form has been resolved. 

## [1.120.1005] - 2024-06-12

### Added

- **setAutoDestroyOnESC()** method has been added to the **FragmentCL** class. If this method is executed with **true** parameter, the dialog content will be destroyed automatically by the class.

## [1.120.1004] - 2024-06-11

### Added

- `viewDependent` parameter has been added to the **openAsync()** and **open()** methods of the **FragmentCL** class. If this parameter is set to true, dialog or popover is added as a dependent to the source view using the **addDependent()** method of the MVC View class.
- **closeAndDestroy()** method has been added to the **FragmentCL** class. With this method, it is no longer necessary to call **close()** and then **destroyFragmentContent()**. This method does both.
