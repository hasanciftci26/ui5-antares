### Added

- Initial productive release.

### Changed

- The sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context class does not have the **delete()** method in the 1.96.25 SAPUI5 version. It is replaced with the **remove()** method of the sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel class. The **EntryDeleteCL** class still works the same. It is only a technical change.

### Removed

- sap.m.ColorPalettePopover is not supported by the FragmentCL class in this version.
